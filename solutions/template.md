# Solutions Doc Content Template

This is a template of content blocks and doesn't address any stylistics, which are highly secondary in any case.
##Revision history
* Added revision history section

## Goals and Use Case:

* What is the product and who is the customer audience?
* What specific issue/condition/intention does this solution address?
* What issues/conditions does this solution not address? Reference the related solution docs for these.
* There will likely be "Parent" pages explaining different, similar solutions (i.e. Salesforce using SAML vs. Del Auth).  This section should clearly state which option you are focused on.

## Assumptions and Prerequisites:

The list of anything necessary to implement the solution: 

* required hardware
* OS versions
* **product software versions** (both Ping's products and the version of anything else used)
* roles (admin)
* network access, etc.

## Solution Summary

Brief, general description of what the solution entails and its result. This can be text, a diagram/flowchart, or a mix these.  

## Stepped Instructions

* Numbered (use "1.", "2.", "3.", etc to number.)
* Addresses orientation (where am I?) and navigation (where do I go and how do I get there?). 
* In general, one action per step.
* Keep the actions linear: Don't loop back for an action (or series), instead repeat instructions if necessary. Note: As a final step, having folks repeat the entire set of instructions, if needed (i.e. for each node in a clustered environment) is fine.  Feel free to reference other solutions.

## Result of Completed Steps

Describe the expected result.

## Verification

How do you verify that the solution has indeed worked?  Include common errors that might appear and how to fix them.  Detailed troubleshooting should be in a KB article and referenced below.

## References

* Product docs site(s) for the relevant Ping products.
* Main site for all Solutions docs.
* Support KB site.
